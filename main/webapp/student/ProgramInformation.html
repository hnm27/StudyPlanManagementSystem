      <h2 class="col-l-12" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: left"> COURSE PROGRAMME 2019-2020 </h2>
      <br>
      <p> The course programme forms 2019-2020 for all three Computer Science specializations are available on this page. Missing forms will be added shortly, but if you need to discuss your programme in the mean time, please use the forms from the previous year.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Within the first quarter / 15 EC of your programme you need to agree upon your course programme together with your programme mentor. This starts with filling out the course form and if necessary discussing this with your programme mentor. Eventually the agreed upon programme will be processed by BOZ (Educational Affairs Office) after which it will be visible as your examination programme in Osiris.</p>
      <p>If you want to switch out courses or change your programme later on, you can use either the below form and explain what and why exactly you want to change (in the appropriate field) or use the <a href="course-alteration.doc" download> <u>course alteration form.</u> </a> </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> The two-year Masterâ€™s in Computer Science comprises at least 120 credits and is taught entirely in English. In accordance with your own specific interests, you will specialize in one of the following fields: </p>

      <h2 class="col-l-12" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: left"> WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE </h2>
      <br>
      <p>ICT is omnipresent in modern society. The latest hardware and software developments are crucial in domains such as social media, security, health, energy, ICT systems, finance and telecom. That's why our programme focuses on the development of ICT systems in their societal context and also on technological aspects and applications of embedded systems.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Development processes of sophisticated software systems are also crucial. You will be trained to combine a scientific mind-set with specialist technical knowledge. You will also learn to design, analyse, validate and implement state-of-the-art ICT systems in their operational context.</p>
